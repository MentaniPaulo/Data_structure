# Linked List

This is a C++ program that implements a singly linked list data structure. It allows you to add elements to the list, search for elements by value, and print all elements in the list.

# Once you have a linked list object, you can use the following member functions:

void add(type element): Adds a new element to the linked list in a sorted manner.

linked_list* find_by_value(type value): Searches the linked list for an element with the given value and returns a pointer to the first occurrence, or nullptr if the element is not found.

void print_All_Element(): Prints all elements in the linked list.

int list_size(linked_list* element): Returns the number of elements in the linked list starting from the input element.
